## About
*This is a bundle for [NodeCG](https://github.com/nodecg/nodecg); if you do not understand what that is, we advise you read their website first for more information.*

speedcontrol-tweetr is a bundle for NodeCG to allow users to schedule and post tweets without actually logging into the website. This bundle is meant for speedrunning marathons, therefore it includes all the features one might need to pull off an online marathon. Gone are the days where you need to use Tweetdeck or manually schedule tweets for your marathon!

### Modifications
This version of tweetr is different from [Nic's version](https://github.com/nicnacnic/speedcontrol-tweetr). The main difference is that it is written in typescript and is built on top of zonton's template.
It also has some additional features like tweeting once the transition to the game scene.

### Features
- Post tweets directly from the dashboard, without having to login to the website!
- Schedule tweets based on the active run, or create new tweets and send them instantly
- Include embedded images and videos in your tweets
- Enable and disable auto tweeting
- Integration with esa-layouts
- Import and export tweets
- Based on the [Vue template](https://github.com/zoton2/nodecg-vue-ts-template)

## Requirements
- [NodeCG](https://github.com/nodecg/nodecg)
- [NodeCG Speedcontrol](https://github.com/speedcontrol/nodecg-speedcontrol)


## Installation
To install, navigate to your root NodeCG directory and run the following command.

```
cd bundles
git clone https://github.com/bsgmarathon/speedcontrol-tweetr.git --branch build
cd speedcontrol-tweetr
npm install --production
```

After the installation completes, create a config file by running `nodecg defaultconfig speedcontrol-tweetr`.

**NOTE:** You most likely want to turn `useEsaLayouts` off in the config

You will need to create a Twitter Developer account and get an API key/secret and an access token/secret to connect to Twitter. Make sure you get enhanced access with read **and** write privileges to avoid any errors!

## Usage
Once the bundle is configured properly, usage is pretty simple. On first load, the bundle should automatically retrieve all runs and load them into the bundle. To edit tweets, simply select your game in the dropdown and press `Edit`. There is a 280 character limit. Make sure to save, then press anywhere outside of the dialog to exit.

For media, upload images and videos through NodeCG's asset tab, located in the top-right. To select the media you want to use for your tweet, open the dropdown and select your file. Supported formats are png, jpg, gif and mp4. Images can not be larger than 5 MB, GIF's 15 MB, and videos 512 MB. Make sure your filename does **not** have spaces or invalid characters, and your media is within the size limit, or it will cause your NodeCG instance to crash.

To enable Auto Tweet, press the button in the Settings tab of the NodeCG dashboard. Countdown time specifies how long you have to cancel the tweet, 60 seconds is recommended. Once you switch runs, the button will show a countdown, you can either cancel the tweet (you can always tweet it later!), or wait for the countdown to finish, then the tweet will be sent.

The text box at the bottom is for when you want to quickly compose and post a tweet without attaching it to a run. The limits to character count and media size still apply here as well.

## Standalone usage

If you would like your social media team to use Tweetr, but don't want them to be confused by the full dashboard, you can always pop out Tweetr to a standalone window. To do this, press the new window button in Tweetr's panel, this should pop out the window into a new tab. Alternatively, you can also use this link: `http://<your_ip>:9090/bundles/speedcontrol-tweetr/dashboard/tweetr.html?standalone=true`. Everything but the edit dialog works (this is a limitation with NodeCG).

**Security note:** Anyone who has access to Tweetr by default has access to your entire NodeCG instance, as NodeCG does not have user-level permissions and only supports a simple yes/no authentication state (if login security is enabled). Securing your NodeCG production instance is outside the scope of this bundle, please see the [official documentation on Security & Authentication](https://www.nodecg.dev/docs/security/).

# Importing/Exporting Tweets
To make life easier when you are trying to post many tweets at once, you can import a .csv file with your tweet data.

1. Load all your runs into NodeCG.
2. Export your tweets by pressing the **Export Tweets** button in the Settings tab in NodeCG.
3. Load the .csv file into your favorite sheets software and edit away!

When you're done, simply export your file as a .csv and import it back into Tweetr with the **Import Tweets** button. Make sure to not change any of the headers in the spreadsheet or it could cause errors!

At the moment, media is not automatically uploaded, so make sure to manually upload all your media through the dashboard and select the appropriate file for each tweet.
